        <section>
          <p>I&#39;ve been experimenting with Dart and React over the last few months, and as part of these experiments, I&#39;ve been using a pattern that&#39;s inspired by <a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial">Elm</a> to structure data flow.</p>
<p>With this pattern, your application is split up into modules that follow a specific convention. Each module has a state, a view and a set of actions. Modules can be nested infinitely deep inside other modules, but each module is only concerned about its immediate children.</p>
<p>As you&#39;ll see, every module is self contained. They never reach outside themselves to change or get their state. This makes using them as a <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#deferred-loading">deferred library</a> a snap, and helps you keep the initial size of your app small by loading modules only when they&#39;re needed.</p>
<p>This pattern also centralizes the state of you app, and serves as a single source of truth when rendering your views. This eliminates a whole suite of bugs where the internal state of the view can becomes out of sync with the application.</p>
<p>Lastly, state modification and view updates happen through a unidirectional data flow. This simplifies the process of your app updating state and rerendering. Plus, it makes reasoning about your application a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Overall, the pattern&#39;s been working well in these experiments, and we&#39;ve decided to use it on a new product that we just started at <a href="http://www.mixbook.com">Mixbook</a>. I think you&#39;ll find it to be simple, powerful, and will ultimately allow you to create web apps that stay modular.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this pattern is inspired by Elm, but is tailored to support a non-functional language like Dart. However, it can easily be adapted to other languages, like JavaScript, with the help of a reactive library like RxJS or Bacon.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start out by introducing the basic pattern, then use it to build an app that has a single module. After that, we&#39;ll modify the app to reuse the module in a dynamic list. For those of you how like to dive straight into <a href="https://github.com/danschultz/modular_counter_react_dart">source code</a>, the completed app is up on Github for you to look at.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-pattern">The Basic Pattern</h2>
<p>Each module is a Dart library that&#39;s separated into three parts: a state, a view and a set of actions.</p>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>The view is a React component that is passed two properties by its parent module. An <code>actions</code> property that the view uses to change the application&#39;s state, and a <code>state</code> property which the parent uses to change the state of the view.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">class MyView extends react.Component {
  StreamController&lt;Action&lt;State&gt;&gt; get _actions =&gt; props[&quot;actions&quot;];
  State get _state =&gt; props[&quot;state&quot;];

  render() {
    // render the view
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>The state is a simple immutable object that encapsulates the state of a module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">class State {
  final String value;

  State(this.value);
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>Actions are functions that return closures to modify the module&#39;s state. The returned function accepts a single argument of the state to modify, and returns a new object representing the modified <code>State</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">typedef T Action&lt;T&gt;(T state);

Action&lt;State&gt; appendValue(String value) {
  return (State state) =&gt; new State(state.value + value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Flux parlance, the <code>appendValue</code> function is the payload&#39;s action type, its arguments is the payload&#39;s data and the returned closure is the means of modifying the state. With this technique, we remove the need to perform a bunch of conditional statements for the type of action, and we also get type checking for the action&#39;s payload data.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-single-counter">Example: A Single Counter</h2>
<p>The first example is a counter that can be incremented and decremented.</p>
<p>I recommend creating a single library for each module that contains its state, view and actions. This makes using the module a one-line import, and also makes <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#deferred-loading">lazy loading</a> the module a whole lot easier.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter.dart
library counter_demo.views.counter;

import &#39;dart:async&#39;;
import &#39;package:react/react.dart&#39;;

part &#39;counter/actions.dart&#39;;
part &#39;counter/state.dart&#39;;
part &#39;counter/view.dart&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>Our state for this component is pretty simple. It has a single field to represent the counter&#39;s current count.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter/state.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter;

class State {
  final int count;

  State(this.count);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The actions for this component are pretty straight forward as well. We have two actions, one for incrementing and one for decrementing the count on a counter.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter/actions.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter;

Action&lt;State&gt; increment() {
  return (State state) =&gt; new State(state.count + 1);
}

Action&lt;State&gt; decrement() {
  return (State state) =&gt; new State(state.count - 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What&#39;s great about these actions is that they&#39;re stateless. This makes them easier to reason about, but also easier to test. We can create variations of <code>State</code> objects, pass them to these actions and test their results.</p>
<p>Finally, we define the render function for our React component, and setup each of the buttons to add their action onto the <code>actions</code> controller.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter/view.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter;

var view = registerComponent(() =&gt; new View());

class View extends Component {
  StreamController&lt;Action&lt;State&gt;&gt; get _actions =&gt; props[&quot;actions&quot;];
  State get _state =&gt; props[&quot;state&quot;];

  render() {
    return div({}, [
      div({}, _state.value),
      div({}, [
        button({&quot;onClick&quot;: (_) =&gt; _actions.add(decrement())}, &quot;Decrement&quot;),
        button({&quot;onClick&quot;: (_) =&gt; _actions.add(increment())}, &quot;Increment&quot;)
      ])
    ])
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-update-loop">The Update Loop</h2>
<p>So far we&#39;ve defined a module that has a state, a view, and a set of actions. But, we&#39;re not responding to these actions to make anything change. Let&#39;s go over how actions modify the application&#39;s state, and how this triggers some side-effect, such a rerendering the view.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, your application&#39;s state is held inside a <code>scan</code> stream within your <code>main</code> function. This stream transformer isn&#39;t provided by Dart, so we use <a href="https://github.com/danschultz/frappe">Frappe</a> to provide this functionality.</p>
<p>Using a <code>scan</code> stream is nice, because it&#39;ll hold the current application state, but also modify it whenever an action is added to the controller. Since our state is represented by a stream, we can react to its changes and trigger some behavior, like updating the view.</p>
<p>If we wanted, we could also apply other transformations to our state stream. For instance, we could convert our state to JSON using <code>Stream.map()</code> and update the browser&#39;s history. Or maybe we could use Frappe&#39;s <code>Stream.debounce()</code> to throttle and persist the state to some external API.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">import &#39;dart:html&#39;;
import &#39;package:frappe/frappe.dart&#39;;
import &#39;package:react/react.dart&#39; as react;
import &#39;package:react/react_client.dart&#39; as react_client;
import &#39;package:counter/views/counter.dart&#39; as counter;

void main() {
  react_client.setClientConfiguration();

  var applicationElement = querySelector(&quot;#application&quot;);
  var initialState = new counter.State(0);

  var controller = new StreamController&lt;Action&lt;counter.State&gt;&gt;();
  var actions = new EventStream&lt;Action&lt;counter.State&gt;&gt;(controller.stream);
  var state = actions.scan(initialState, (state, action) =&gt; action(state));

  state.listen((state) {
    var view = counter.view({&quot;state&quot;: state, &quot;actions&quot;: controller});
    react.render(view, applicationElement);
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>There&#39;s a bit going on here, so lets break down listening to the actions from our module and updating the application&#39;s state.</p>
<ul>
<li>We define the initial state of our application, with a starting count of 0, and assign it to <code>initialState</code>.</li>
<li>We define a <code>StreamController</code>, assign it to <code>controller</code>, and pass it to the module&#39;s view. The view will request changes to the application state by adding actions onto this <code>StreamController</code>.</li>
<li>We use Frappe&#39;s <code>scan</code> transformer to apply actions from our view to the previous state of the application.</li>
<li>We listen to the <code>state</code> stream and rerender the view whenever it changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of this process as an endless cycle of <code>Render -&gt; User Action -&gt; State Modification -&gt; Render</code>.</p>
<h2 id="example-many-counters">Example: Many Counters</h2>
<p>Lets try to stress the architecture a bit by introducing a dynamic list of counters.</p>
<p>Our general architecture is the same, we create a new module <code>counter_list</code> that contains a state, a view and a set of actions. The UI for this module includes a button to create a new counter, a list of the inserted counters and a button to remove them.</p>
<p>To start, lets create the <code>counter_list</code> library. Along with the React import, we&#39;ll also import our previous counter module and alias it as <code>counter</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter_list.dart
library counter_demo.views.counter_list;

import &#39;dart:async&#39;;
import &#39;package:react/react.dart&#39;;
import &#39;package:counter_demo/views/counter.dart&#39; as counter;

part &#39;counter_list/actions.dart&#39;;
part &#39;counter_list/state.dart&#39;;
part &#39;counter_list/view.dart&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>The state for this module will include a list of counters, and an ID to assign to the next counter.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter_list/state.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter_list;

class State {
  final Iterable&lt;counter.State&gt; counters;
  final int nextId;

  State(this.nextId, this.counters);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since we want the ability to add, remove and update a counter, the module will include actions for each behavior.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter_list/actions.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter_list;

Action&lt;State&gt; createCounter() {
  return (State state) {
    var newCounter = new counter.State(state.nextId, 0);
    var counters = state.counters.toList()..insert(0, newCounter);
    return new State(state.nextId + 1, counters);
  };
}

Action&lt;State&gt; removeCounter(int id) {
  return (State state) {
    var counters = state.counters.toList()..removeWhere((c) =&gt; c.id == id);
    return new State(state.nextId, counters);
  };
}

Action&lt;State&gt; updateCounter(int id, Action&lt;counter.State&gt; action) {
  return (State state) {
    var counters = state.counters.map((c) =&gt; c == id ? action(c) : c);
    return new State(state.nextId, counters);
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Something to take note of is the <code>updateCounter</code> action. Here we&#39;re passing the identifier of the counter to update, and an action that returns a new counter to replace it with. This paradigm is how the state of a child module gets merged into its parent. This will become clearer once we define the view for our <code>counter_list</code> module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-dart">// lib/views/counter_list/view.dart
part of counter_demo.views.counter_list;

var view = registerComponent(() =&gt; new View());

class View extends Component {
  StreamController&lt;Action&lt;State&gt;&gt; get _actions =&gt; props[&quot;actions&quot;];
  State get _state =&gt; props[&quot;state&quot;];

  render() {
    var counters = _state.counters.map((counter) =&gt; _renderCounter(counter));

    return div({}, [
      button({&quot;onClick&quot;: (_) =&gt; _actions.add(createCounter())}, &quot;Create a Counter&quot;),
      div({}, counters)
    ])
  }

  _renderCounter(counter.State state) {
    var counterActions = new StreamController();
    counterActions.stream.listen((action) {
      _actions.add(updateCounter(state.id, action));
    });

    return div({}, [
      counter.view({&quot;state&quot;: counter, &quot;actions&quot;: counterActions}),
      button({&quot;onClick&quot;: _actions.add(removeCounter(counter.id))}, &quot;Remove&quot;)
    ]);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As previously mentioned, we need to modify the states of a counter in the counter list. To handle this, we create a new stream controller for each counter view that it can add actions onto. When an action is added, it&#39;s associated with an ID using <code>updateCounter</code> which applies the action to the specific counter in the counter list.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that a module is only responsible for its direct children. At no time is a module reaching down to a grandchild to modify state, or is it ever reaching outside itself to get its state. The actions for grandchildren will always be propagated up by the module&#39;s children, and the state of the module will always be passed by its parent.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>To summarize, here are some take aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each module is a self-contained library that has a view, a state and a set of actions. This keeps the API for each module standardized and makes it easy to turn into a <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#deferred-loading">deferred library</a>.</li>
<li>Modules can be nested infinitely, and each module is only concerned about its immediate children.</li>
<li>Your application state is centralized and serves as the source of truth when triggering side effects, eliminating bugs where the state of a component becomes out of sync with the state of the application.</li>
<li>Testing is made easier from the use of immutable classes and declarative actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in looking further into this architecture, the <a href="https://github.com/danschultz/modular_counter_react_dart">source code</a> for this app is up on Github. There&#39;s also a <a href="https://github.com/danschultz/modular_todo_react_dart">TodoMVC</a> example that&#39;s a bit more involved.</p>
<p>I hope you give this a try in one of your apps, and if you do, let me know how it went in the comments below.</p>
